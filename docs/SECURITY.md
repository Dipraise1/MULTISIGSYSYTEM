# Security Overview

This document outlines the security features and considerations for the MultiSig Wallet project.

## üîí Security Features

### Multi-Signature Protection
- **Threshold Signatures**: Configurable M-of-N signature requirements
- **Owner Management**: Secure addition and removal of wallet owners
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels for different operations

### Time-Lock Mechanisms
- **Transaction Delays**: Configurable time delays before execution
- **Emergency Override**: Ability to bypass time locks with unanimous consent
- **Grace Periods**: Time windows for canceling pending transactions

### Smart Contract Security
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for all functions
- **Emergency Pause**: Circuit breaker for suspicious activity
- **Upgradeable Design**: Proxy pattern for security updates

### Advanced Security Features
- **Social Recovery**: Trusted guardians can help recover wallets
- **Spending Limits**: Daily/monthly limits with override mechanisms
- **Hardware Wallet Integration**: Support for Ledger and Trezor
- **Gasless Transactions**: Meta-transactions for better UX security

## üõ°Ô∏è Smart Contract Audits

### Ethereum Contracts
- Uses OpenZeppelin's audited libraries
- Implements EIP-1271 for signature validation
- Compatible with Safe (Gnosis Safe) ecosystem
- Gas-optimized operations

### Solana Programs
- Built with Anchor framework for additional safety
- Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for security
- Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) safety
- Account validation and ownership checks

## üîê Key Management

### Private Key Security
- **Never Store Private Keys**: Client-side key management only
- **Hardware Wallet Support**: Integration with major hardware wallets
- **Seed Phrase Protection**: BIP39 mnemonic generation and validation
- **Key Derivation**: Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet support

### Transaction Signing
- **Offline Signing**: Support for air-gapped transaction preparation
- **QR Code Integration**: Mobile app signing via QR codes
- **Biometric Authentication**: Fingerprint/face recognition on mobile
- **Multi-Device Coordination**: Secure signing across devices

## üö® Threat Model

### Identified Threats
1. **Private Key Compromise**: Single point of failure mitigation
2. **Smart Contract Bugs**: Formal verification and audits
3. **Frontend Attacks**: CSP and SRI protection
4. **Social Engineering**: User education and warnings
5. **Phishing Attacks**: Domain verification and warnings

### Mitigation Strategies
- Multi-signature requirements
- Time-locked transactions
- Spending limits
- Social recovery mechanisms
- Regular security audits

## üìã Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Verify Addresses**: Always double-check recipient addresses
2. **Use Hardware Wallets**: Store keys on hardware devices
3. **Enable Time Locks**: Use delays for large transactions
4. **Regular Backups**: Secure backup of recovery phrases
5. **Stay Updated**: Keep software updated

### For Developers
1. **Code Audits**: Regular security reviews
2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing
3. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Secure Development**: Follow OWASP guidelines
5. **Incident Response**: Have a security incident plan

## üîç Vulnerability Reporting

### Responsible Disclosure
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do Not** disclose it publicly
2. Email security@multisigwallet.com
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes before disclosure

### Bug Bounty Program
We offer rewards for security vulnerabilities:
- **Critical**: $10,000 - $50,000
- **High**: $5,000 - $10,000
- **Medium**: $1,000 - $5,000
- **Low**: $100 - $1,000

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Transaction pattern analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Gas price monitoring
- Contract state monitoring

### Alerting System
- Email notifications for large transactions
- Push notifications for mobile app
- Discord/Telegram bot notifications
- Emergency contact system

## üîÑ Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and user reports
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Pause contracts if necessary
4. **Investigation**: Analyze the incident
5. **Recovery**: Implement fixes and resume operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures
